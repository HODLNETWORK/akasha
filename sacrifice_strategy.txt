AKASHA SACRIFICE STRATEGY

1. Cross-Chain Expansion Model
- Each new chain deployment creates sacrifice opportunity
- Previous chain's LP remains locked, building permanent liquidity layers
- Sequence: Base -> BSC -> Solana -> (future chains)
- Each phase incentivizes LP creation on the previous chain

2. Smart Contract Architecture
- Chain-specific SacrificeVaults for each deployment phase
- Tiered locking system per chain:
  * 1 Year Vault: 1.5x multiplier (next-chain tokens)
  * 5 Year Vault: 2.5x multiplier (next-chain tokens)
  * Forever Vault: 4x multiplier + governance rights (next-chain tokens)

3. Technical Implementation
a) Main Registry Contract (per chain)
- Tracks sacrifices for next-chain distribution
- Handles multiplier calculations
- Permanent record of liquidity creation
- Chain-specific snapshots for airdrops

b) Vault System
- Non-migratable LP token vaults
- Builds permanent liquidity layers on each chain
- Each vault becomes part of protocol's multi-chain liquidity foundation
- Emergency functions controlled by timelock governance

4. Cross-Chain Distribution Strategy
- Each phase distributes tokens for the next chain
- Example flow:
  * Phase 1: Lock Base LP → Get BSC tokens
  * Phase 2: Lock BSC LP → Get Solana tokens
  * Phase 3: Lock Solana LP → Get (next chain) tokens
- Creates cascading liquidity effect across chains

5. Incentive Structure
- Early participant bonus (first 48 hours: +10%)
- Chain-specific bonuses based on market conditions
- Governance rights for forever-lockers on each chain
- Cumulative benefits for multi-chain participants

6. Technical Implementation Example:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

uint256 tokenId = nextTokenId++;
// Transfer LP tokens to permanent vault
lpToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, getVaultForDuration(lockDuration), amount);
// Record sacrifice for next-chain distribution
sacrifices[tokenId] = Sacrifice({
amount: amount,
lockDuration: lockDuration,
timestamp: block.timestamp,
multiplier: multiplier,
chainId: targetChainId

userSacrifices[msg.sender].push(tokenId);

emit NewSacrifice(msg.sender, amount, lockDuration, multiplier, tokenId, targetChainId);
}
}


7. Benefits
- Creates permanent liquidity on each chain
- Each phase strengthens previous deployments
- Incentivizes early adoption on new chains
- Builds cross-chain protocol stability

8. Marketing Approach
- "Build the Cross-Chain Empire" campaign
- Chain-specific community engagement
- Phased announcements for new chain deployments
- Transparency on locked liquidity growth

9. Security Measures
- Chain-specific audits
- Multi-sig controls per chain
- Independent vault contracts
- Cross-chain monitoring system

10. Long-term Strategy
- Each phase increases total locked liquidity
- Creates sustainable cross-chain presence
- Builds protocol value across multiple chains
- Enables future chain expansion opportunities

This revised strategy focuses on building permanent liquidity layers across multiple chains rather than migration, creating a stronger and more sustainable protocol presence in the ecosystem.


Wallet Strategy 

a) Deployment Wallets:
- Create new hardware wallet (e.g., Ledger) specifically for protocol deployment
- Set up multi-sig (e.g., Gnosis Safe) with trusted team members
- Structure:
  * Deployment Wallet (Hardware secured)
  * Protocol Treasury Multi-sig (3/5 or similar)
  * Emergency Admin Multi-sig (2/3 for time-sensitive operations)

b) Access Levels:
- Deployment wallet: Initial contract deployment only
- Treasury Multi-sig: Token distribution, major parameter updates
- Emergency Multi-sig: Pause/unpause, emergency functions


Phase 1 - Development (Kyle)
- Deploy to testnet with minimal setup
- Use development wallet
- Document all steps and security requirements
- Create comprehensive test suite

Phase 2 - Team Review
- Present PoC to team
- Security review of wallet structure
- Define multi-sig participants
- Establish deployment checklist

Phase 3 - Production Preparation
- Set up production wallets/multi-sigs
- External audit of contracts
- LayerZero endpoint verification
- Cross-chain testing suite

Phase 4 - Mainnet Deployment
- Deploy from secured deployment wallet
- Transfer ownership to multi-sigs
- Verify all cross-chain connections
- Begin sacrifice period
